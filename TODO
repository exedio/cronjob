TODO for cronjob

* a public method for deactivate/activating all jobs
	The deactivation method must wait until the all cronjobs are finished.
	So this must be the same functionality as destroy()
* careful evaluation, that no threads are lost
* careful evaluation, that after destroy has been called, no
	new cronjob can start
* send email on failure
* refactoring: use TimerTask
* log last failure / last success
* log trigger cause (auto/manual) and authentication used
* allow specification of time of day (2am-4am)
* add lots of junit tests
