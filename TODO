* a button to activate/deactivate all jobs
* a public method for deactivate/activating all jobs
	The deactivation method must wait until the all cronjobs are finished.
	So this must be the same functionality as destroy()
* careful evaluation, that no threads are lost
* careful evaluation, that after destroy has been called, no
	new cronjob can start
* use jspm for the frontend
* send email on failure
