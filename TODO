* test environment on a tomcat with several typical example tasks:
	+ a task taking a long time
	+ a task taking a short time
	+ a task that fails always
* a button to activate/deactivate all jobs
* a public method for deactivate/activating all jobs
	The deactivation method must wait until the all cronjobs are finished.
	So this must be the same functionality as destroy()
* careful evaluation, that no threads are lost
* careful evaluation, that after destroy has been called, no
	new cronjob can start
* use jspm for the frontend
* facility, to advice a cronjob, that it should terminate as soon as possible
	so destroy() returns faster.
* send email on failure
